## Hatching Day

Our shell just cracked! Reddi-Pet is a Tamagotchi-inspired companion that plugs directly into Reddit Interactive Posts. Every tap, upvote, and comment becomes nutrition for the tiny creature living inside the LCD.

Here is what we focused on for the initial release:

- **Reddit-native gameplay.** We built the pet with Devvit so it can live right inside a post and soak up the community's energy.
- **Authentic 90s texture.** Pixel art, scanlines, and crunchy button tones keep the nostalgia dial turned to max.
- **Mod-friendly DNA.** The stat engine is open for creator tweaks—swap snacks, remix evolutions, or write new mini-games.

## Feeding Rituals

To keep the pet thriving, we mapped classic Tamagotchi needs to Reddit mechanics:

1. **Hunger → Upvotes.** Every upvote dispenses a sprinkle of XP kibble.
2. **Happiness → Comments.** Conversations act like mini-play sessions.
3. **Cleanliness → Daily prompts.** Answer the prompt, wipe the screen, keep the mood high.

If you're planning to mod Reddi-Pet, drop your own rituals into the scripts folder, update `posts.json`, and watch them auto-populate this blog.

> Tip: ship an animated gif of your pet's latest evolution as the thumbnail inside your post. It converts scrollers into caretakers instantly.

## What's Next

We're already prototyping a **community boss fight** that lets multiple subs pool stats to hatch a legendary pet. Keep an eye on this feed for telemetry on that experiment!

Stay crunchy, keep feeding your pet, and ping us on Reddit if you build something wild.
